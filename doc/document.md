# MoosasPy

MoosasPy is the Python core of MOOSAS, a building-performance analysis and
optimization toolkit for the early design stage. It converts geometry into a
structured building model and provides model exchange, weather preparation,
energy analysis, solar-radiation and daylight calculation, airflow simulation,
and coupled analysis workflows.

This repository contains the Python package and its native runtime resources.
It does not contain the former SketchUp plug-in, Ruby code, browser interface,
or a portable Python distribution.

The three main public API areas are:

| API | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `MoosasPy.transform` | Convert GEO, OBJ, or STL geometry into a `MoosasModel`. |
| `MoosasPy.MoosasModel` | Load, inspect, edit, and save complete building models. |
| `MoosasPy.simulation` | Run energy, radiation, weather, airflow, and coupled workflows. |

## Requirements and Installation

MoosasPy requires Python 3.10 or newer. From the repository root, install the
package with:

```bash
python -m pip install .
```

For development, tests, and package validation, install the development extras:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
python -c "import MoosasPy; print(MoosasPy.__version__)"
```

Package versions are derived from Git tags matching
`moosaspy-vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

## Usage

### Quick Start

Transform a geometry source and save the resulting model:

```python
from MoosasPy.transform import TransformOptions, transform

options = TransformOptions(attach_shading=True)
model = transform("building.geo", options=options, stdout=None)

print(len(model.spaceList))
model.save("building.ttl")
```

Load the saved model without rerunning geometry transformation:

```python
from MoosasPy import MoosasModel

model = MoosasModel.load("building.ttl")
model.summary()
```

At the package root, `transform` is the transformation module rather than the
function itself:

```python
from MoosasPy import transform

model = transform.transform("building.obj", stdout=None)
```

Importing the function directly from `MoosasPy.transform` is recommended for
application code.

### Geometry Transformation

Geometry transformation is the required entry point for raw geometry:

```python
transform(
    input_path: str,
    input_type: str | None = None,
    *,
    method=CCRSpaceGeneration,
    options: TransformOptions | None = None,
    stdout=sys.stdout,
) -> MoosasModel
```

Parameters:

- `input_path`: path to a GEO, OBJ, or STL source.
- `input_type`: optional explicit `"geo"`, `"obj"`, or `"stl"` override.
- `method`: space-generation callable. The default is `CCRSpaceGeneration`.
- `options`: immutable `TransformOptions` shared by all pipeline stages.
- `stdout`: transformation log stream. Pass `None` to suppress log output.

`transform()` returns a complete `MoosasModel`. It does not write an output
model automatically; call `model.save()` explicitly.

The current transformation options are:

| Option | Default | Effect |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `solve_duplicated` | `True` | Remove duplicated geometry. |
| `solve_redundant` | `True` | Merge redundant coplanar geometry. |
| `solve_overlap` | `True` | Resolve overlapping faces. |
| `triangulate_faces` | `True` | Triangulate horizontal faces where required. |
| `break_wall_vertical` | `True` | Split walls at building levels. |
| `break_wall_horizontal` | `True` | Split walls at horizontal intersections. |
| `attach_shading` | `False` | Retain unused faces as shading or thermal mass. |
| `divided_zones` | `False` | Convexify complex zones. |
| `simplify_boundary` | `False` | Simplify source boundaries before generation. |
| `insert_core` | `False` | Insert a minimal core into eligible boundaries. |
| `standardize` | `False` | Standardize the finalized model geometry. |

Example with explicit processing choices:

```python
from MoosasPy.transform import TransformOptions, transform

options = TransformOptions(
    attach_shading=True,
    divided_zones=True,
    standardize=True,
)
model = transform("massing.obj", options=options)
```

Do not use model-file formats such as RDF, XML, JSON, or IDF as transformation
inputs. Those formats enter through `MoosasModel.load()`.

### Building Model

`MoosasModel` stores geometry, spaces, topology, thermal settings, schedules,
weather references, and resources required by downstream analyses. Common
collections include:

- `spaceList`: conditioned and unconditioned spatial units.
- `wallList`: vertical opaque faces.
- `faceList`: horizontal faces, including floors and ceilings.
- `glazingList`: window elements.
- `skylightList`: skylight elements.
- `levelList`: detected building levels.
- `buildingTemplate`: available thermal-setting templates.
- `schedule` and `scheduleByType`: loaded schedule definitions.

Use `model.summary()` for a level-by-level element and area summary.

### Model I/O

Complete model I/O is exposed through the model itself:

```python
from MoosasPy import MoosasModel

model = MoosasModel.load("building.rdf")
result = model.save("building.xml")

print(result.primary_path)
print(result.generated_paths)
```

Supported formats:

| Format | Load | Save | Notes |
| --- | :---: | :---: | --- |
| RDF / Turtle (`.rdf`, `.ttl`) | Yes | Yes | Turtle serialization is used. |
| XML (`.xml`) | Yes | Yes | Uses a same-named `.geo` geometry sidecar. |
| JSON (`.json`) | Yes | Yes | Uses a same-named `.geo` geometry sidecar. |
| EnergyPlus IDF (`.idf`) | Yes | Yes | Requires EnergyPlus 26.1 format. |
| Graph JSON (`.graph.json`) | No | Yes | Graph-oriented export. |
| gbXML (`.gbxml`) | No | Yes | Exported through the RDF-to-gbXML adapter. |

GEO, OBJ, and STL are geometry sources, not complete serialized models. Load
them with `transform()`.

IFC conversion and inspection functions are available from
`MoosasPy.model.io.ifc`, including `writeIfc`, `loadIfc`, `rdf_to_ifc`,
`ifc_to_rdf`, and `inspect_ifc`. IFC is intentionally not dispatched through
`MoosasModel.load()` or `model.save()` because its conversion contract is
different from the complete-model formats above.

#### EnergyPlus IDF Contract

MoosasPy reads and writes EnergyPlus 26.1 IDF files using the bundled 26.1
`Energy+.idd`. Older IDFs must first be migrated with the official EnergyPlus
Transition chain. MoosasPy does not provide an automatic legacy-IDF fallback.

### Apply Thermal Settings

Each `MoosasSpace` receives a default residential template during model
construction. Apply another packaged or user-provided template with
`space.applySettings()`:

```python
for space in model.spaceList:
    space.applySettings("climatezone3_GB/T51350-2019_RESIDENTIAL")

model.spaceList[0].settings["zone_equipment"] = 8.8
```

The argument can be an exact template key, a regular-expression hint matching
a key in `model.buildingTemplate`, or a template dictionary already present in
that mapping. Applying a template also updates face U-values and glazing SHGC.

Important energy-setting fields include:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `zone_wallU` | Opaque-envelope U-value in W/(m²·K). |
| `zone_winU` | Window U-value in W/(m²·K). |
| `zone_win_SHGC` | Window solar heat-gain coefficient. |
| `zone_c_temp`, `zone_h_temp` | Cooling and heating set points in °C. |
| `zone_collingEER`, `zone_HeatingEER` | Cooling and heating efficiency values. |
| `zone_ppsm` | Occupant density in people/m². |
| `zone_pfav` | Outdoor-air requirement per person. |
| `zone_popheat` | Sensible heat per person in W/person. |
| `zone_equipment`, `zone_lighting` | Equipment and lighting loads in W/m². |
| `zone_infiltration`, `zone_nightACH` | Infiltration and night ventilation rates. |
| `zone_template` | Applied template identifier. |

Building templates are stored in `MoosasPy/db/building_template.csv`; schedule
libraries are stored under `MoosasPy/db/schedule/`.

### Weather Data

Weather APIs use immutable `Location` and `WeatherData` records. Convert a
user-provided EPW file in a caller-owned output directory:

```python
from MoosasPy.simulation.weather import load_epw

weather = load_epw("custom.epw", "analysis-input/weather")

print(weather.location)
print(weather.temperature.shape)
```

Prepare an EPW file in a caller-owned output directory:

```python
from MoosasPy.simulation.weather import prepare_epw

prepared = prepare_epw("custom.epw", "analysis-input/weather")

weather = prepared.weather
cumulative_skies = prepared.cumulative_skies
```

`load_epw()` creates the converted weather CSV needed by the native energy
engine. `prepare_epw()` additionally creates WEA and cumulative-sky assets.
Neither function performs station lookup or modifies a packaged database.

## Building-Performance Analysis

Simulation domains are available under `MoosasPy.simulation`:

```python
from MoosasPy import simulation
```

Native runners share a common contract. A runner returns a frozen
`SimulationResult` subclass containing domain results, command diagnostics,
warnings, and a workspace report.

### Energy Analysis

`EnergyRunner` runs the residential or public energy model directly in Python.
It returns an `EnergyResult` with structured energy data:

```python
from MoosasPy.simulation.energy import EnergyRunner
from MoosasPy.simulation.weather import load_epw

weather = load_epw("custom.epw", "analysis-input/weather")
result = EnergyRunner(
    model=model,
    weather=weather,
    temporal_scale="daily",
    spatial_scale="zone",
).run()

print(result.data["total"])
```

`temporal_scale` accepts exactly one of `"monthly"`, `"daily"`, or
`"hourly"`; its default is `"monthly"`. `spatial_scale` accepts
`"building"` or `"zone"` and defaults to `"building"`. Results expose only
the requested temporal scale, with an additional zone-scale field when zone
output is requested.

Other energy options include the building type (`core`), radiation mode, and
schedule path. `core` accepts `buildingType.RESIDENTIAL`, `OFFICE`, `HOTEL`,
`SCHOOL`, or `COMMERCIAL`. Apply the matching climate-zone building template
to each space before simulation; the non-residential types share the public
building calculation path and use their templates and schedules for distinct
occupancy, equipment, and lighting profiles.

Radiation modes are:

- `0` or `False`: fast geometry-based estimate.
- `1` or `True`: consume precomputed seasonal radiation totals.
- `2`: consume precomputed radiation schedules.

Use `build_energy_input()` when direct access to the generated zone parameters
and engine configuration is necessary.

### Radiation Calculation

The fast radiation API uses the packaged Moosas radiation engine:

```python
from MoosasPy.simulation.radiation import modelRadiation
from MoosasPy.simulation.weather import prepare_epw

prepared = prepare_epw("custom.epw", "analysis-input/weather")
modelRadiation(model, prepared.cumulative_skies, reflection=0)
```

The radiation package exposes calculations at several scales:

| Function | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `modelRadiation` | Update seasonal radiation values for every space. |
| `spaceRadiation` | Calculate seasonal radiation for one space. |
| `faceRadiation` | Calculate sky-patch visibility or radiation for a face grid. |
| `positionRadiation` | Calculate cumulative radiation at directed positions. |
| `rayTest` | Test ray intersections and reflections against a model or GEO scene. |
| `positionSunHour` | Calculate direct sunlight duration. |

`positionRadiation()` and `rayTest()` require either a model or an explicit GEO
scene path. Batch rays into one call when possible to reduce native-process
overhead.

### Radiance Daylight Analysis

`RadianceRunner` performs a daylight calculation in an isolated workspace:

```python
from datetime import datetime

from MoosasPy.simulation.radiation import RadianceRunner, RadianceSky
from MoosasPy.simulation.weather import load_epw

weather = load_epw("custom.epw", "analysis-input/weather")
sky = RadianceSky(
    date=datetime(2026, 6, 21, 12),
    sky_type="+s",
    location=weather.location,
    diffuse_illuminance=15000.0,
)
result = RadianceRunner(model, sky).run()

for floor in result.floors:
    print(floor.uid, floor.daylight_factor, floor.satisfied_fraction)
```

`RadianceSky` takes its location from the EPW metadata; latitude and longitude
are not separate simulation inputs.

Each floor result contains grid illuminances, daylight factor, and the fraction
of points exceeding 300 lux. The runner reports the `oconv` and `rtrace`
commands used by the calculation.

### Ventilation Analysis

`MoosasPy.simulation.airflow` accepts a `MoosasModel`, constructs its airflow
network, generates a CONTAM project, and performs buoyancy/sensible-heat
iterations inside one runner call.

Run an airflow simulation directly from a model:

```python
from MoosasPy.simulation.airflow import AirflowRunner

result = AirflowRunner(
    model=model,
    outdoor_temperature=25.0,
    max_iterations=50,
    convergence_tolerance=0.01,
).run()

print(result.converged, result.iteration_count, result.residual)
for zone in result.zones:
    print(zone.user_name, zone.temperatures, zone.ach_values)
```

`AirflowResult` contains the final airflow matrix, immutable per-zone histories,
convergence state, native-command diagnostics, warnings, and the retained
workspace report. Intermediate network JSON, CONTAM projects, and iteration
steps are implementation details rather than public simulation inputs.

Bundled CONTAM executables support Windows x86-64 and Linux x86-64. Other
architectures fail explicitly.

### Coupled Workflows

Cross-domain orchestration belongs to `MoosasPy.simulation.coupling`; energy,
radiation, airflow, and weather modules do not import one another directly.

Energy with calculated radiation:

```python
from MoosasPy.simulation.coupling import run_energy_with_radiation
from MoosasPy.simulation.weather import prepare_epw

prepared = prepare_epw("custom.epw", "analysis-input/weather")
data = run_energy_with_radiation(
    model,
    weather=prepared.weather,
    cumulative_skies=prepared.cumulative_skies,
    radiation_mode=1,
    reflection=0,
)
```

The coupling package also provides:

- `EnergyAirflowCoupler` for coupled thermal-load and airflow workflows.
- `run_roof_pv` and `run_facade_pv` for hourly photovoltaic generation.
- `calculate_face_incident_energy` for face-level incident solar energy.

`EnergyAirflowCoupler` delegates every hourly airflow solve to
`AirflowRunner`. Its `iteration` argument sets the maximum internal iterations;
CONTAM project paths and individual iteration functions are not coupling API
inputs.

Example photovoltaic calculation:

```python
from MoosasPy.simulation.coupling import run_roof_pv
from MoosasPy.simulation.weather import prepare_epw

prepared = prepare_epw("custom.epw", "analysis-input/weather")
hourly_generation = run_roof_pv(
    model,
    prepared.cumulative_sky_matrix,
    useful_area_ratio=0.7,
    efficiency=0.17,
)
```

## Native Engines and Workspaces

Energy, Radiance, and airflow runners execute native commands through the
`NativeEngine` protocol. `SubprocessEngine` is the default local
implementation; tests and integrations can provide another engine explicitly.

Each calculation uses `SimulationWorkspace` to isolate intermediate files:

- Temporary workspaces are cleaned automatically.
- A caller-provided root or a retained workspace remains available after the
  calculation.
- `WorkspaceReport.path` identifies the workspace.
- `WorkspaceReport.retained` states whether it remains on disk.

Native resources must remain in their packaged locations under `MoosasPy/libs`.
Do not move individual executables away from their support files.

## File Formats Used by Native Tools

The stable public interfaces generate native input files automatically. The
main internal formats are:

| File | Consumer | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.geo` | Geometry transform and radiation engine | Categorized polygon faces, normals, and vertices. |
| `.net` | Native AFN project builder | Zones, openings, topology, pressure, and boundary data. |
| `.prj` | CONTAM | Multizone airflow project. |
| `.info` | Airflow iteration | CONTAM zone name, heat load, and user zone name. |
| `.rad` / `.oct` | Radiance | Scene description and compiled octree. |

These are internal execution contracts. Prefer the Python builders and runners
unless another tool must exchange one of these files directly.

## Runtime Resources

The installed package expects the following directories to remain adjacent to
the Python modules:

- `db/`: building templates, schedules, weather records, material data, the
  EnergyPlus 26.1 IDD, and the default IDF template.
- `libs/rad/`: the Moosas radiation engine and Radiance executables/resources.
- `libs/vent/`: AFN tools and platform-specific CONTAM distributions.
- `libs/weather/`: EPW-to-WEA and cumulative-sky executables/resources.

The Python distribution includes these resources through `pyproject.toml` and
`MANIFEST.in`.

## Testing

Tests and fixtures belong under the repository-level `test/` directory. Run the
full suite from the repository root:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

The suite covers geometry regressions, model I/O, resource packaging,
EnergyPlus version enforcement, native runners, simulation workspaces, weather
architecture, and domain boundaries.

## Packaging and Release

Build and validate distributions from the repository root:

```bash
python -m build
python -m twine check dist/*
```

The accepted release tag format is:

```text
moosaspy-vX.Y.Z
```

On Windows, the release helper can validate and publish a tag:

```powershell
.\scripts\release_moosaspy.ps1 1.2.2
```

The GitHub Actions release workflow builds the wheel and source distribution,
creates a GitHub Release, and uploads both artifacts. GitHub Packages does not
provide the PyPI-compatible registry used by this project; install a release
wheel through its GitHub Release URL or publish the same distributions to PyPI.

Use the release helper's `-DryRun` option to preview tag operations. Replacing
an existing release requires `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` with repository
contents permission so the helper can remove the previous GitHub Release before
the workflow uploads artifacts with the same names.
